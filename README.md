My career background is in international development and humanitarian action in vulnerable and conflict-affected contexts, and I'm eager to use and improve my skills while contributing to various projects.
-  I'm comfortable using a variety of tools and languages, including Python and various libraries (incl. Pandas, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib), Java, MySQL, HTML, CSS (incl. Bootstrap), and VanillaJS).
