- 👋 Hi, I’m @josidridolfo
- 👀 I’m interested in leveraging technology and creating dedicated, pragmatic tools to streamline workflows at NGOs.
- 🌱 I have an MA in Philosophy from Northern Illinois University, and I am currently a Master of Science in Computer Science student at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Science. My career background is in international development and humanitarian action in vulnerable and conflict-affected contexts.
-  I'm comfortable using a variety of tools and languages, including Python and various libraries (incl. Pandas, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib), Java, MySQL, HTML, CSS (incl. Bootstrap), and JavaScript (especially React and Redux). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are practical and in-line with my humanitarian values.
- 📫 How to reach me - PM me here!
